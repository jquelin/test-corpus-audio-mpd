=head1 NAME

Test::Corpus::Audio::MPD - automate launching of fake mdp for testing purposes

=head1 VERSION

version 1.113280

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Corpus::Audio::MPD; # die if error
    [...]
    stop_test_mpd();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module will try to launch a new mpd server for testing purposes.
This mpd server will then be used during L<POE::Component::Client::MPD>
or L<Audio::MPD> tests.

In order to achieve this, the module will create a fake F<mpd.conf> file
with the correct pathes (ie, where you untarred the module tarball). It
will then check if some mpd server is already running, and stop it if
the C<MPD_TEST_OVERRIDE> environment variable is true (die otherwise).
Last it will run the test mpd with its newly created configuration file.

Everything described above is done automatically when the module
is C<use>-d.

Once the tests are run, the mpd server will be shut down, and the
original one will be relaunched (if there was one).

Note that the test mpd will listen to C<localhost>, so you are on the
safe side. Note also that the test suite comes with its own ogg files.
Those files are 2 seconds tracks recording my voice saying ok, and are
freely redistributable under the same license as the code itself.

In case you want more control on the test mpd server, you can use the
supplied public methods. This might be useful when trying to test
connections with mpd server.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 customize_test_mpd_configuration( [$port] );

Create a fake mpd configuration file, based on the file
F<mpd.conf.template> located in F<share> subdir. The string PWD will be
replaced by the real path (ie, where the tarball has been untarred),
while TMP will be replaced by a new temp directory. The string PORT will
be replaced by C<$port> if specified, 6600 otherwise (MPD's default).

=head2 my $dir = playlist_dir();

Return the temp dir where the test playlists will be stored.

=head2 start_test_mpd();

Start the fake mpd, and die if there were any error.

=head2 stop_test_mpd();

Kill the fake mpd.
